			<p>Through my journey as an artist, I’ve noticed that when people watch their favorite films or read through the their favorite literature, they have the most genuine expression of happiness on their face. It’s somewhat exciting to see how different forms of art come together to bring positivity to peoples’ days. I’ve always wanted to create art that would appeal to people’s emotions, to make invest them into my work. As a digital media artist who focuses on creating digital and analog interactive applications, I too want to create works that will inspire others to do the same. </p>
            <p>
My art ranges from digital painting to game development and web design. I like to explore the digital medium because of it allows me to translate my ideas in many different ways. As a senior student attending San Jose State University, I’ve found comfort in creating art that brings joy and excitement to the viewer. I try not to focus on any big issues or controversies, my work isn’t some grand, society-reforming declaration. Rather, it’s representative of human imagination and potential, to allow the viewer a moment to crack a pure and innocent smile.</p>
            <p>
For my project titled, Homebound, I created a narrative-based pixel art game that focuses on the bittersweet loneliness of leaving home to explore the world. To discover new things you have to let go of old ones. It’s a story-driven game in which the player is sent on a journey through the world to find where he/she belongs. The game is meant to reflect my personal journey into college and having to leave my hometown behind.

				<h3>Gabemonogatari</h3>
				<p>Here is a funny little semi-animated project I did where I remixed dog barks into a song. The dog is named Gabe and he was a famous internet dog back in 2016-2017. Unfortunately Gabe has passed away. This video was meant to be a tribute to the good doggo. Rest in Peace Gabe.</p>
